# Job interview questions

## S.T.A.R. Method

Star stands for Situation, Task, Action, Result

**Situation:** The candidate should detail the background and provide a context.
What when and why.

**Task:** Let the candidate describe the challenge and expectations.
What needed to be done? Why?

**Action:**
Ask the candidate to elaborate on a specific action. What did he do.
How did he do it and what tools did you use.

**Results:**
Have the candidate explain the results; accomplishments, recognition, savings,
etc. quantify his answers.


Example questions:
- Did a client (or executive, manager) ever compliment you?
  - In what situation?
- What was a hard decision you made in past few months.
  - Why was it a hard decision?
  - Given the same situation would you have made the same decision or would you
    have done something differently?
  - Why?

- Did you ever loose your patience?
  - How did it happen?
  - How could it be prevented?

- Tell me about the most significant accomplishment in your life.
  - What challenges did you face?
  - How did you face those challenges?
  - How did it impact your organization?

- What is your biggest failure?
  - Could you have avoided it?
  - What would you do differently if you where in the same situation again?


## Other Questions

### Personal

- Tell me more about your self (personal life, hobby’s etc.).
- Tell me more about your career history.
- Where do you see your self in 5 years.
- If I where to meet a former colleague of yours what would they tell me about you?
- What is your dream job?
- Why are you leaving your current job?


### Did the candidate research the company?

- What do you know about the company?
- What do you expect from working here?
- Why do you want this job?
- What do you think we could do better or differently?


## Brain teasers

These questions with unseemingly impossible answers are designed to see how the
candidate will react with uncertainty, if the candidate can communicate clearly
and can think analytical. The candidate should ask for clarification, time to
think and set parameters in which a solution is found. Then the candidate should
explain a plan to attack the problem.

Example question: *How many windows are there in New York City?*

An good answer might look like this:
> Are you thinking only about building windows or are you including others like  car windows and even computer screens?> Do you want me to actually give you an answer or, in the interest of time,  should I just give you my plan of attack?> OK, since you only want building windows and a plan to estimate them, here are  the steps I’d go through:> - First, I’d estimate the number of buildings by segment> - Second, I’d estimate the average number of windows per building segment> - Third, I’d combine those two answers to get a total> Does that sound like a fair plan? If so, I’m happy to dig into the specifics:> First, I’d want to know how many buildings are in NYC. I’d estimate that by
  estimating how many homes, offices, and stores are in New York. Even though
  that leaves out things like museums and libraries, it seems like those would
  be marginal compared to the first three categories.

> OK, based on my experience living in 2-person apartments, I usually have about  6 windows - so let’s say there are 3 residential windows per person or 30  million residential windows total.> Now, onto offices. So lots of folks commute into New York everyday. So I’m  going to assume that the working population of New York is actually 30 million  at least it seems that way on the subway! Is that fair?> And again, in my experience, there are probably 3 workers per window when you  factor in bosses vs cubes. So let’s say there are 10 million office windows.  I know that’s a much lower ratio than for residential but it seems like you  just don’t need as much natural light because of all the overheads and the  need for efficiency.> Lastly, it’s hard to know just how many retail locations there are. But let’s  say it’s roughly 1/3 of the space in New York. In that case, if we figure that  retail is probably better-windowed than office space - for aesthetics, but  fewer than homes, we can average the two and say there are 20 million retail  windows.> Which gives us 60 million in all. Although I’m not 100% satisfied with that  number, since we neglected development trends in the city. Even though,  historically, there are relatively few windows per people, every new building  I’ve seen is an all-glass monster. Which suggests that this number is probably  on the low side.
